# 1.Homelessnesslustering_Algorithm_Comparisons
OBJECTIVE:

This project consists of 4 distinct tasks revolving around a dataset tracking the services used by homeless people in Maricopa County, Arizona. The overarching objective was to design a risk model that assessed the likelihood of people falling back into homelessness after utilizing certain services. An essential component of this was to identify natural clusters of usage patterns within the data. This allowed us to observe how distinct groups of people flowed through the system and to identify success stories within the data. While T settled on the BIRCH algorithm, I am interested in identifying other clustering algorithms that may be more efficient or may tell us an interesting story from the data. I am interested in any approach identified.

The tasks of this project are as follows:

1. Compare the performance and output of various clustering algorithms
2. Implementation of hyperparameter optimization of any clustering algorithm of choice
3. Identify an optimal number of clusters
4. Assess different distance metrics for computing similarity
